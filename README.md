## Features

- User-friendly web interface styled like Facebook's chat
- Handles user input and provides intelligent responses
- Uses a trained neural network model for response prediction
- Automatic spelling correction using the `autocorrect` library
- Tokenization and lemmatization for natural language processing

## Technologies Used

- Flask: For creating the web application
- Keras: For loading the pre-trained neural network model
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks
- Autocorrect: For automatic spelling correction
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Flask
- Keras
- NLTK
- Autocorrect
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for Keras backend)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask keras nltk autocorrect numpy tensorflow
